# Full Stack App with React and a Rest API
 Treehouse Techdegree project 10

This is the final project of the Techdegree at Treehouse. It continues project 9, which was the REST API at the backend. It is a school database app, where the users can get a list of their own courses, create new courses, delete, update and retrieve details of the courses. To be authenticated, the users need to sign up and/or sign in, and when they are signed in, they have access to specific pages.

The project works with React, JSX, React Router, React Context API, and Create React App. The CSS was changed from the original colour of violet to green in different shades, and the layout of the detail pages has been improved.
